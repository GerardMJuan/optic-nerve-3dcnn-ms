## Abstract
Optic neuritis (ON) is one of the first manifestations of multiple sclerosis, a disabling disease with rising prevalence. Detecting optic nerve lesions could be a relevant diagnostic marker in patients with multiple sclerosis.
We aim to create an automated, interpretable method for optic nerve lesion detection from MRI scans.
We present a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) model that learns to detect optic nerve lesions based on T2-weighted fat-saturated MRI scans. We validated our system on two different datasets (N=107 and 62) and interpreted the behaviour of the model using saliency maps.
The model showed good performance (68.11% balanced accuracy) that generalizes to unseen data (64.11%). The developed network focuses its attention to the areas that correspond to lesions in the optic nerve.
The method shows robustness and, when using only a single imaging sequence, its performance is not far from diagnosis by trained radiologists with the same constraint. Given its speed and performance, the developed methodology could serve as a first step to develop methods that could be translated into a clinical setting.

## Repository organization:

* **LesionNerviOpticDataAug/:** Code in bash and MATLAB containing the script to segment and extract patches around the optic nerve for a FAT-SAT scan.
* **old/:** Old, legacy code, preserved this way to suboptimal github organization. Contains old versions of the code which can be useful to directly compare to the current one.
* **cm_auc_creation.ipynb:** Jupyter script to generate figures for the paper from the results.
* **CNN_hyperparamsearch_TRIO.py:** Script for doing an hyperparameter search to select best hyperparameters with the training dataset (D1).
* **CNN_clasification_PRISMA_BONA.py:** Script for testing on the separate dataset (D2). Shares a lot of code with CNN_hyperparamsearch_TRIO.py 
* **SVM_val.py and SVM_test.py:** Scripts to train and test models for the SVM and RF algorithms described in the paper.
* **util_functions.py:** contains functions used across the papers.
